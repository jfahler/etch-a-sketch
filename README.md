# etch-a-sketch

TOP project for DOM Manipulation. Link to project description on TOP: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project

* Finished on 26 June 2020 with some known bugs/challenges: 
- unable to figure out how to get canvas to be able to change to a smaller size - perhaps/probably I should rerun some functions but I'm too tired to add this now
- need to add some sort of mobile compatibility perhaps? 

-fun fact: I learned that caps matter with git (readme.md != README.md :) )
